# Experimental set of rsync filtering rules for modelE code
# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
# Has only been tested as follows:  rsync -aF source_dir/ target_dir/
# The filters are applied in this directory and all its
# subdirectories.  Some of these rules could/should be moved
# into subdirectory-specific .rsync-filter files.

# Skip Git repository info
- .git

# Skip object files, libraries, Fortran module files
- *.o
- *.a
- *.mod
- *.smod

# Skip emacs saves
- *~
- .*~

# Only copy certain files from the decks directory
+ decks/Makefile
- decks/*

# Skip (directories for) temporary files
- model/include/*
- *.ERR
- .current_options
- .depend*
- .depend_subdirs
