! --- CH4 tracer specific settings: ---
!    important:
use_rad_ch4=0      ! use rad code CH4, shut off sfc sources
ch4_init_sh=1.750      ! init cond/fixed conditions SH CH4 ppmv
ch4_init_nh=1.855      ! init cond/fixed conditions NH CH4 ppmv
CH4_nBBsources=0 ! if non-zero make sure last-CH4_nBBsources-listed CH4 emissions files are the desired
                 ! ones to mix through PBL
!    rarer settings:
! Lmax_rad_CH4=0   ! CH4 levels used in rad code default is LM
fix_CH4_chemistry=0    ! for setting fixed methane value for chemistry:
scale_ch4_IC_file=1.d0 ! multiplicative factor on CH4 IC file (fix_CH4_chemistry=-1)
