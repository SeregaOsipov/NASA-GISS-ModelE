NAMELIST PARAMTERS

nl-Parameter (~alph. order)    short Description                         Default
------------                   -----------------                         -------

IHOURE       model time at end of run (hrs since 1/1/Iyear1,hr 0)           (??)
IRANDI       seed for rand.number sequence to perturb init.conditions          0
ISTART       type-of-start flag   1-8 starts, >8 continuations                10
ITWRITE      controls # pages of radiative debug output                        0
IWRITE,      if JWRITE<1500 get rad.info for box (Iwrite,Jwrite)               0
JWRITE       if JWRITE>1500 get forcing info for years Iwrite->Jwrite          0
IYEAR1       base year for internal clock ("Itime=0"="1/1/Iyear1,hr 0")   =YEARI
KDIAG        controls amount of diagnostic printout (0=full->9=none)      12*0,9
QDIAG        controls whether binary diagn. files are created (ij,jl..)  .false.
QDIAG_ratios fields with titles "q1 x q2" are replaced by field/q2        .true.
QCHECK       activates the checking routines (checkt ... )               .false.

Note:  default=?? indicates that no reasonable default is set:
----              value has to be set in the rundeck

Except for IYEAR1, none of these parameters are part of a restart file, i.e.
they are not remembered on restarts unless they are read in again (from I),
however, some of these parameters are used to find parameters that are saved.

---------------------------------------------------
ISTART:        -1: postprocessing
       -1: read and process 1 or more diagn. acc-files (pdE)
              1-8: initial starts from :
        1: homogeneous atmosphere, ground data from file
        2: obs. atmosphere, all data from files
      3-6: currently unused (starts from older models)
        7: from old converted end-of-month rsf- or M-file
        8: from end-of-month restart file (rsf- or M-file)
             9-13: restarts from:
        9: from end-of-month restart file (rsf- or M-file)
       10: from later of fort.1 or fort.2 (tries earlier, if newer is bad)
       11: from fort.1
       12: from fort.2
       13: from earlier of fort.1 or fort.2 (14-99 same as 13)

    difference between ISTART=8 and ISTART=9:
    8: start of a new run - parameters from rundeck+defaults
       In particular: Itime is set to ItimeI, radiation and all diagnostic
       accumulations are performed in the first hour, IRAND is set to its
       default (unless reset in the rundeck). See note below.

    9: continuation of an old run which happened to have been stopped
       at the beginning of a diagnostic accumulation period

Note: For ISTART=8: Since itime_tr0 defaults to Itime, tracers will be
      reinitialized. To have them keep their setttings from the rsf file,
      set itime_tr0 to < ItimeI (e.g. 0) for all tracers in the rundeck
      parameters. If you use tracers that depend on (Itime-itime_tr0), you need
      to set itime_tr0 to the starting time of the rsf file for continuity.

Note: ISTART defaults to 10 on restarts;
      make sure, that ISTART<10 is never left in 'I', otherwise
      the model goes back to the beginning at each restart !

IHOURE
HOURE,DATEE,MONTHE,YEARE
      are alternate ways to prescribe when the run should stop:
      if IHOURE is set,     HOURE,DATEE,MONTHE,YEARE are ignored
      if YEARE  is NOT set, HOURE,DATEE,MONTHE are ignored.

Note: These variables used to find the saved variable "ItimeE",
      where ItimeE*DTsrc is the time interval (in seconds)
      between 1/1/Iyear1,hr0 and the time the run is stopped, i.e.
      ItimeE*DTsrc = IHOURE*3600 .

HOURI,DATEI,MONTHI,YEARI are used to find the saved variable ItimeI;
      they are ignored on restarts. YEARI has to be specified for initial
      starts (ISTART<9).

IRANDI  If ISTART<10 and IRANDI/=0, the initial temperatures are perturbed
        by up to 1C, the perturbations depend on the value of IRANDI.

QCHECK, Iwrite,Jwrite,ITwrite  - Debug tools
      If QCHECK = .true., all prognostic variables are checked whether
           they are still real numbers after every subroutine called
           from MAIN; some variables are checked whether they lie within
           reasonable bounds. If gross deviations are discovered, the run
           is stopped, indicating after which subroutine and at which
           grid point the error was discovered. Reset QCHECK to .false.
           to continue a run, since the checking is CPU-intensive.

      If Jwrite>Iwrite>1800 selected tables of radiative forcing trends are
            printed (once only) displaying the years Iwrite -> Jwrite. The
            selection depends on ITwrite: 19 shows all forcings, 1/2 GHG,
            3 So, 4/5 O3, 6-9 Aerosols: Trop,DesertDust,Volc,Total.

      If (Iwrite,Jwrite) is a grid box, 1-19 pages are produced for that box
           EVERY NRAD hours. The selection depends on the value of ITwrite.
                ITwrite  0-9 : show item 'ITwrite' only
                ITwrite 11-19: show items 1->last digit of 'ITwrite'
                ITwrite 21-29: show items 0->last digit of 'ITwrite'
         ITwrite

       For debug purposes, ITWRITE=23 is usually sufficient, only
       radiation specialists will profit from any other settings.

KDIAG(1->13) - Suppressing printout if >0
  KDIAG(i) may be used to (partially) suppress type i diagn. printout
      i=1  budget pages,zonal means:
             kdiag(1)=0    print all budget pages
                      1-7  produce pages listed in Ibp
                      8    regional page only
                      9    skip all budget pages
             Editing Ibp: just delete lines, rearranging has no effect
             Note: no regional data files are produced even if qdiag=.true.
        2  latitude-height tables
             kdiag(2)=0   produce all possible tables
                      1-8 produce the tables listed in Ijk (if still possible)
                      9   skip all tables
             Editing Ijk: just delete lines, rearranging has no effect
             Note: some titles may appear in Ijk that have no corr. tables
        3  lat-lon maps
             kdiag(3)=0   standard printout, all binary files if QDIAG=.true.
                      1   ij-fields as in list Iij, all ijk-fields
                      2-7 ij and ijk fields are handled according to list Iij
                      8   ij-fields as in list Iij, no ijk-fields are produced
                      9   suppress all ij and ijk fields
             Editing Iij: don't touch lines starting with 'List' or 'list'
                     you may delete any other lines
                     you may rearrange the remaining ij-fields only (not ijk)
                     you may add blank maplets (up to 10)
        4  energy history           skip if kdiag(4)=9
        5  spectral analysis        skip if kdiag(5)>3
                                       else: with 1=SH  2=NH  3=Equ  4=45N
