<H1>Options for running the GISS GCM</H1>

<p>There are a number of 'plug and play' options available for ModelE,
and there will be more soon. The essence of this is that by a simple
change of filename in the rundeck, a new model will be compiled and
run, without any further coding necessary. (A good thing!).  Remember
that you must recompile the model and replace the executable for any
change to be effected. (i.e. 'gmake exe RUN=E001xyz')</p>

<p>This is a brief list of the current options:</p>
<ul>
<li> Example Resolutions (horizontal and vertical)

<pre>
RES_M12   ! 4x5 (medium resolution) 12 vertical layers 
RES_M20A  ! 4x5 (medium resolution) 20 vertical layers (up to 0.1mb)
RES_M23   ! 4x5 (medium resolution) 23 vertical layers (incl. stratosphere)
RES_F12   ! 2x2.5 (fine resolution) 12 vertical layers 
</pre>

<p>Other resolutions (such as M18, F18 etc. with or without
stratospheric code) can be used as required. Note that these files
also contain some dummy routines that can be replaced by other options
(see below).</p>

<li> Momentum advection scheme:<P>
<pre>
MOMEN2ND  !  2nd order advection scheme (12 layer DT = 450 sec)
MOMEN4TH  !  4th order advection scheme (12 layer DT = 300 sec)
</pre>

<li> Binary output from postprocessing<P>

<pre>
POUT    ! Standard GISS output 
	! ij arrays: TITLE*80,DATA(IM,JM)*R4,ZMEAN(JM)*R4,GLOB*R4
	! jl/jk arrays: TITLE*80,IX,IY,IZ,IT,X(IX,IY,IZ,IT),XCOOR(IX),
        !               YCOOR(IY),ZCORR(IZ),TCORR(IT),CX,CY,CZ,CT,'NASAGISS',
        !               ASUM(IX),GLOB,ZMEAN(IZ)
	! j arrays: (ASCII) aplot format 
POUT_netcdf: Full netcdf format for all fields
</pre>

<p>Other output methods may also be defined.</p>

<li> Ocean model treatment

<p>The ocean treatment is set in a couple of ways. For the basic
(no-dynamics) ocean, there are three options: a) fixed SST, b) Mixed
layer ocean (with fixed ocean heat transports, and c) Mixed layer
ocean with fixed transports and deep diffusion into the next few thousand m).
The fixed SST run is set by using KOCEAN = 0 in the rundeck, while the
Qflux ocean is set by KOCEAN = 1. Whether this gives the simple mixed
layeer ocean or the deep diffusing ocean, depends on the following
'plug and play' options:</p>

<pre>
OCEAN OCNML !  fixed SST ocean or simple Qlfux
OCEAN ODEEP !  fixed SST ocean or deep diffusing Qflux 
</pre>
The fixed SST ocean requires the following files: OSST, SICE, OCNML, MLMAX<br>
The Qflux ocean requires in addition: OHT <br>
The deep diffusion Qflux model also requires: EDDY and TG3M<br>

<p>For dynamic oceans, the only current option is to use  </p>

<pre>
ODIAG_COM OCEAN_COM OSTRAITS_COM OGEOM !
OCNDYN OSTRAITS OCNGM OCNKPP OCNFUNTAB ! - Russell Dynamic Ocean
ODIAG_PRT                              ! 
</pre>

<p>In time, other ocean models will also be incorporated.</p>

<li> Dynamic Ice treatment 

<p>The advection of sea ice can be used with all ocean models
(including the qflux ocean). If a qflux version with advective ice is
required, the spin-up where the qfluxes are calculated must include
the dynamic ice modules so that the heat convergence from horizontal
ice motion can be included in the vertical flux calculations. Ice
dynamics can be switched off by using the dummy 'plug-and-play'
option: </p>

<pre>
ICEDYN_DUM        !  dummy ice dynamics
ICEDYN_DRV ICEDYN !  ice dynamics 
</pre>

<p>Please note that for the qflux models, you must be consistent in
your choice (i.e. if dynamics are in the spin up, they must be in the
qflux run also).</p>

<li> Atmospheric mixing<P>

<pre>
DRYCNV   ! original scheme. complete mixing of dry statically unstable column.
ATURB    ! turbulence scheme that diffuses tracers as a function of second
         ! order colsure calulations of effective diffusivity.
</pre>

<li> Stratospheric diagnostics<P>

<pre>
STRAT_DIAG  ! calculates full set of zonally averaged EP-fluxes. Must be
            ! used in conjunction with a suitable RES_Xnn file. 
            ! (i.e. one that does not have dummy routines EP*, and sets
            ! KEP to be non-zero).
</pre>

<li> Stratosphere dynamics (Gravity wave drag)<P>

<pre>
STRATDYN  ! Calculates and applies gravity wave drag in the
          ! dynamics. This MUST be used for all strat models, but can
          ! also be used for tropospheric models. Note that a suitable
          ! RES_Xnn file must be used in conjunction. (i.e. One that
          ! does not have a dummy GWDRAG, VDIFF or io_strat).
</pre>

<li> Fast fourier transforms<P>

<pre>
FFT36: Suitable for IM=36 models 
FFT72: Suitable for IM=72 models 
FFT144: Suitable for IM=144 models
</pre>

<li>General diagnostics<P>

<pre>
nradfrc=0: No radiative forcing diagnostics are printed in the output, saving
           many radiation calls (thus CPU time). These are mostly tracer and 
           cloud related diagnostics. For optical depth, no band[1-6] are
           generated, saving further radiation calls, but only band6 is saved
           in the output (and is named tau).
nradfrc=1 (default): Radiation diagnostics are saved for both tracers and
                     clouds, as well as band[1-6] diagnostics. Essentially any
                     value nradfrc>1 falls in the nradfrc=1 group.
</pre>

<li> Tracers <P>

<ul> 

<li> General Tracers <p>
<p>
Tracers are implemented through a combination of 'plug and play' and user 
routines.  Some tracer code is embedded in the main model through the use 
of pre-processing directives.  To activate the directives, change the 
rundeck line: </p>
<pre>
!#define TRACERS_ON                  ! include tracers code
to 
#define TRACERS_ON                  ! include tracers code
</pre>

Three preprocessing directives have been defined so far: TRACERS_ON is
for all tracers, TRACERS_WATER is used if any tracers interact with
the hydrologic cycle in the atmopshere/sea-ice/lakes and rivers, and
TRACERS_OCEAN if tracer advection in the ocean is required (currently
only functional with the the GISS OCEAN option).  Also, 'plug in':
<pre>
TRACER_COM TRACERS_DRV              ! configurable tracer code
TRACERS                             ! generic tracer code
TRDIAG_COM TRACER_PRT               ! tracer diagnostic printout
</pre>
<p> 

TRACERS, TRDIAG_COM and TRACER_PRT were written to be independent of
tracer type.  For most users, only TRACER_COM need be changed to alter
the number of tracers, and their physical type. The tracer library is
included in TRACERS_DRV only needs editing if a brand new tracer is to
be incorporated, or the properties of one of the existing tracers
needs changing. The tracers in these routines are for illustrative
purposes only. However, the 'Air' and 'Water' tracers are very useful
as diagnostic tools since they are designed to mimic the movement of
air and water mass. The user is responsible for checking that tracer
subroutines are called at the appropriate times in MAIN for his
purpose.  Be sure to check that .f files with tracer directives start
with #include "rundeck_opts.h" Tracers parameters that can be changed
in the rundeck: </p>

<pre> 
to_volume_MixRat=1: tracer concentration printout in volume mixing ratio
to_volume_MixRat=0: tracer concentration printout in mass mixing ratio
to_per_mil=1: tracer concentration in per mil units (for water tracers)
itime_tr0: the model time at which each tracer 'turns on'.</pre>
</pre>

<p> Note that tracer code involving the ocean needs the OCN_TRACER
module, in addtion to those specified above.  </p>

<li> Regional Tracers <p>

The preprocessor directive <code>#regional_Ox_tracers</code> will turn on tracers
which can be defined by a geographic domain.  In the present implementation, 
there are 6 regional Ox tracers (named OxREG1, ... OxREG6), which interact
with the Drew Shindell chemistry if #TRACERS_SPECIAL_Shindell is turned on
as well. Therefore Ox should also be a tracer and should be defined before
the regional tracers. The number of regional Ox tracers is controlled by
the NregOx parameter in TRACER_COM, and their 3D geographic regions are
defined in TRACERS_DRV, by setting the varaibles:
<pre>
regOx_n = northern limit in degrees
regOx_s = southern limit in degrees
regOx_w = western limit in degrees
regOx_e = eastern limit in degrees
regOx_b = bottom limit in hPa
regOx_t = top limit in hPa
</pre>
