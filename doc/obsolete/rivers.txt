INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING CUBED SPHERE RD FILES

* convert STN-30p.bin to STN_C90:
STN-30p.bin is located in the input file directory. It is the raw distance to the ocean file downloaded from http://www.grdc.sr.unh.edu/index.html
to do the conversion, compile inputll2cs using the command gmake input in aux/
and then run inputll2cs, which created STN_C90

* calculate river directions:
use RDtoO.CS90.F in the input file directory. It reads STN_CS90 and converts it to RDtoO.CS90.INT

an alternate driver RDtoO.CS90EM.F contains hardcoded 911 directions. It creates the file RDtoO.CS90EM.INT

* convert RDtoO.CS90 from Gary's i,j,tile format to latlon format:
use RDijk2ll.f in aux/ which you compile using gmake csrvr. This creates the file RDdistocean_CS90.bin

an alternate driver RDijk2llEM.f also reads and writes the 911 directions. This creates the file RDdistocean_CS90_EM.bin

CONVERTING RIVER DIRECTIONS FILE FROM ascii to binary
* edit RDconv-stand.f
* compile using ifort -convert big_endian RDconv-stand.f -o RD
* ascii -> binary : ./RD -a RD_Fc.RVR
* binary -> ascii : ./RD -b RD_Fc.RVR.bin
