<H3><A NAME="Q1"> General Questions </A></H3> 

<P><A NAME="Q1_1"><b> 1) Why has all the coding been moved out of main?
</b></a> </P>

<P> In order to increase the modularity of the code, many tasks that
were previously in main and input (input/output, initialisations,
diagnostics etc.) have been moved to the relevant physical
module. Thus, main should not vary as much between model
versions. Also, changes to a module (to the number of prognostic
variables, the functionality etc.) should now only concern that module
and not the rest of the model. This should make it easier to 'plug and
play' new functionality.  </P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_2"><b> 2) Why is modular code so great anyway?</b></a></P>

<P>
So that if you want to change something, you only need to do it in
the part of the code directly affected. There should be much less
unforseen consequences to seemingly minor changes.
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_3"><b> 3) Why are there three files for every module, why
not just one?</b></a></P>

<P>
There are generally three logical parts of each module: a common
block (that owns the variables on the main model grid and/or saves
output from a module that might be used by another part of the code),
the local physics (for instance, the pure 1D column physics) and the
drivers (the programs that access the local physics routines, do
initiallisation etc.). The reason that they are in seperate files is
mainly because of the logical dependencies between the main model and
module variables. Consider a situation where the module needs
information from another module - i.e. there is a USE statement in
one of the drivers. Conceivably, that module might USE a variable
from this module also. Since we now use an automatically generated
list of dependencies in the makefile, this would create a circular
dependency if the USE statements and the variable definitions were in
the same file. Therefore, at minimum the common block and the drivers
must be seperated. We choose generally to make the local physics a
seperate file also because it is not usually dependent on anything
except the CONSTANT module and possibly the main model common block.
Thus it does not need to be recompiled everytime something in the
drivers or common block changes. However, sometimes the local physics
is in the same file as the COM module.
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_4"><b> 4) How do I know where do find definitions and
declarations then?</b></a></P> 

<P>The rules are relatively simple (but not yet implemented 100% of
the time). 
<UL>
  <LI>Variables defined on the model grid are in the COM file.
  <LI>Module specific parameters are in the local physics module. 
  <LI>local variables are defined wherever they are needed. 
  <LI>Variables from other parts of the code are listed in the USE only
       statements. 
</UL>
One exception to this is when local parameters are required by another
part of the model (i.e. for the input NAMELIST), then the variable
might be defined in the local physics module, USE'd by the COM module
and only accessed through COM. - Drivers can USE both the COM
variables and the local physics parameters.
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_5"><b> 5) Why doesn't the model produce 'nice' output as
it runs?</b></a></P> 

<P>The GISS GCM output is of the form of accumulation files, and
since the accumulated quantities are neither averaged or scaled,
looking directly at these 'acc' files is not very illuminating. So it
is a fact that the running output is not 'nice'. However there are a
number of reasons why we do it this way. Firstly, the accumulated
arrays are generally the basic model values. The 'nice' diagnostics
that are required are generally a function of a number of these
variables. Accumualted arrays and files can be concatenated very
easily (and thus averaged trivially) without having to worry about
the length of time each array was accumulated (say a different number
of days in two different months). The average of derived quantities
(such as the albedo) is not the same as the quantity derived from the
average (which is usually what is required). Accumulated arrays allow
you to do both depending on what is needed. A great many diagnostics
can be derived after the fact, without having to have thought about
them ahead of time. 
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_6"><b> 6) Something is wrong with the advection, my
tracers are going haywire!</b></a></P>

<P>This is not a problem in the advection. The GISS dynamical core is
unique in that it uses more information than just the mean tracer
amount in a particular grid-box. We currently use two flavours of
tracer advection, the linear and the quadratic upstream schemes. The
linear scheme carries 3 first order moments along with the mean,
while the quadratic scheme carries an additional 6 second order
moments. These can be thought of as representing the spatial
gradients of the tracer concentration at the centre of a gridbox.
Thus a higher degree of accuracy for the tracer distribution in the
box can be found as a Taylor series expansion in the moments. This is
used in the advection routines to accurately move tracer
mass from box to box. However, as should be clear, if the moments are
incorrect or corrupted in any way, the advection will be compromised,
even to the point where negaitve tracer amounts might appear. This is
usually what has happened when the model crashes after advecting
tracers. 
</P>

<P>What could cause the the moments to be corrupted? Generally, the
coding of the tracers did not consider the effects on the moments of
a particular physical process. The most serious omission is not to
reduce the moments in the same proportion as the tracer mass is
reduced. This omission can leave tracer moments significantly larger
than the mean tracer amount, and implies a sub-grid scale tracer
profile that is not positive definite. Please read the document
<A HREF="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/~gavin/slopes.html"> Using tracer
moments in the GISS GCM </A> for further
information on how to use the moments in a useful fashion.</P>

<p><A NAME="#Q1_7"><b> 7) The model crashed in the dynamics near the
pole. What should I do?</b></A></p>

<P>Occasionally (every 15-20 model years), the model will produce very
fast velocities in the lower stratosphere near the pole (levels 7 or 8
for the standard layering). This will produce a number of warnings
from the advection (such as <tt>limitq warning: abs(a)>1</tt>) and then
finally a crash (<tt>limitq error: new sn &lt; 0</tt>"). There are a number of
things you can do to get past such an error: i) Go back to the last
monthly rsf file and use ISTART=4, ii) change DT to a smaller value
(like 180 sec), run past the crash for a couple of days, and then
increase DT back to normal afterwards.</P>

<P>The second option is more straightforward and can be dealt with
automatically (see <a href="HOWTO.html#part1_2f"> here </a> for more
details). The first option is not guaranteed to work unless
the number of hours that have elapsed from the start of the run to the
end of the last month are <em>not</em> an integer multiple of
NRAD. (This is to ensure that the model will follow a different
path). If there is a problem, then going back to the previous months
restart file generally works.</P>

<P>Please make a note in the rundeck that this happened, and how you
fixed it.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_8"><b> 8) Why should I switch to using modelE?</b></a></P>

<P>It is of course up to you. However, there are a number of reasons
why it makes sense for you to make the effort involved in upgrading.
<UL>
  <LI> modelE fixed a number of bugs (some major, some minor) that may
       still exist in your code. 
  <LI> subsequent changes and upgrades for modelE will be significantly
       easy than it was for model II' 
  <LI> adding diagnostics is much more straightforward 
  <LI> acc files now have more information (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) and
       'pd'-like programs are now more robust 
  <LI> modelE is double precision throughout
  <LI> modelE will eventually be the only model version supported by the
       programmers. 
  <LI> modelE is more modular, more flexible and easier to understand 
  <LI> modelE has made explicit most of the dependencies that were
       hidden in model II'. Thus minor changes are less likely to have
       devastating knock on effects. 
  <LI> modelE is written using a lot of Fortran 90, and a lot less Fortran
       66. 
  <LI> modelE comes with automatic Makefile generation from the rundeck. 
  <LI> modelE comes ready for parallelisation, coupling and tracers.
</UL>
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_9"><b> 9) Why do I get single precision answers from
double precision variables?, and what are all those 'd0'
doing?</b></a></P>

<P>All numbers in the GCM should be accurate to the degree of their
representation, however, many are not. This mostly stems from the
automatic conversion that takes place when a single precision or
integer number is converted to a double precision variable. In the
following examples the double precision variables will only be
accurate to 6 or so decimal places (instead of the 12 or so
expected).</P>

<pre>
      REAL*8 X
      X = 0.1 =&gt; 0.10000000149011612
      X = 1/3 =&gt; 0. (integer division)
      X = 1./3. =&gt; 0.3333333432674408 
      X = 1./3 =&gt; 0.3333333432674408 
      X = 0.3333333333333333 =&gt; 0.3333333432674408 (!!!!)
</pre>
<P>To get double precision results you must use 'd' ie. X=0.1d0 or
1d-1 X=1d0/3d0 or 1./3d0 or even 1d0/3  
</P>

<P>Note that for decimals expressable exactly in binary formulation,
there are no problems, ie. X=0.5 is the same as X=5d-1. Where integer
division is concerned, the integer is converted to the type of the
numerator (I think). Thus <tt>1./IM </tt>gives only single precision. 
<tt>REAL*8 :: FIM = IM, BYIM = 1./FIM </tt> gives double precision
(since the denominator is already double precision).</P>

<P>On some compilers there is a compiler option (such as -r8) that
removes these problems, but not all. Hence for maximum portability we
are trying to be explicit about writing those 'd0's out.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q1_14"><b>14) The model core dumps!</b></a></P>
<p>
This problem can arise from a multitude of causes; only the most
common ones unrelated to (heretofore undetected) programming errors
can be outlined here.</p>

<ul>
<li>
The disk on which your simulation is running has filled up.
</li>
<li>
If you are running a model version known to work in a computing environment
other than yours, check that your "stack" is large enough.
See the stacksize discussion of the
<a href="HOWTO.html#part0_3">System Requirements</a> section for
details.  Linux systems in particular have small stack defaults.
</li>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="Q2"><b> 2. FAQs about the Parameter database.</b></a></H3>

<P><A NAME="Q2_1"><b> 1) What did we do? </b></a></P>

<P> We replaced parameter lists JC and RC and corresponding common blocks
with a Parameter Database.</P>  

<P><A NAME="Q2_2"><b> 2) Why did we do this? </b></a></P>

<P>The following goals were pursued: 
<UL>
  <LI> make restart files more universal, so that they would remain
       compatible if some parameters are added or removed 
  <LI> make introduction of new parameters more simple and
       straightforward 
  <LI> allow each module to work with its own parameters independently,
       i.e. add/remove parameters without editing any source code outside of
       the module which is using them 
  <LI> make the code more readable and more self-documenting and get rid
       of structures like BLOCK DATA which are not in Fortran 90 style
</UL>
</P>

<P><A NAME="Q2_3"><b>3) How was it done? </b></a></P>

<P>We created a module which keeps a database of all parameters used
in the model and provided a library of interface routines. These
interface routines are used to get the values of parameters from the
database (or to set new parameters in the database). Rundeck
parameters are loaded automatically (with one call in INPUT) into this
database when the program starts. This database is saved to restart
file each time when restart file is written.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q2_4"><b>4) How does it work? </b></a></P>

<P>For each parameter the database keeps its name as a character
string and its value (or list of values for an array). To get a value
of a parameter <code>&quot;my_param&quot;</code> and assign it to the 
variable <code>var</code>
one would do: 
<P><pre>
      call get_param( &quot;my_param&quot;, var )
</pre><P> 
If one wants
to create a new parameter in the database with the name
<code>&quot;new_par&quot;</code> and set it to the value var one would do: 
<P><pre>
      call set_param( &quot;new_par&quot;, var ) 
</pre><P>
It is recommended that you use
the same name for the variable and for its name in the database, i.e.:
<P><pre>
     call set_param( &quot;new_par&quot;, new_par ) 
     call get_param( &quot;my_param&quot;, my_param ) 
</pre><P>
This will improve the readability of
the code.</P>

<P>At the restart first all parameters from the rundeck are loaded to
the database with the names as they appear in the rundeck. Then the
restart file is read and those parameters which were saved to it and
were not present in the rundeck are added to the database. If some
parameter was present both in the rundeck and in the restart file then
preference will be given to the rundeck and restart file value will be
ignored. This is done so that you can always overwrite certain
parameters using rundeck.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q2_5"><b> 5) So what are the actual interfaces?</b></a></P>

<P>Rundeck: All parameters have been moved out of the namelist block
to a new block which starts with <code>&amp;&amp;PARAMETERS</code> and ends with
<code>&amp;&amp;END_PARAMETERS</code> This block is being read by a special parser
(not a namelist). The syntax of this block is similar to that of the
namelist with following restrictions: 
<UL>
<LI> only one parameter per line can be specified 
<LI> character strings should be single quoted (like <code>'abc'</code>) 
<LI> arrays can be assigned only as a whole, no support for single
elements 
<LI> all elements of an array should be on the same line 
<LI> repeaters (i.e. expressions like <code>2*123</code>) are not supported 
<LI> only linear arrays are supported 
<LI> the only types supported are: <code>integer, real*8, character*1</code> to
<code>character*16</code> 
</UL>
Since the parser reads parameters from the rundeck right into the
database there is no need to describe those parameters in advance in
any part of the code. The drawback is that the parser has to derive
the type of the data and the size of arrays from the information
provided in the rundeck. The following convention is used: 
<UL>
<LI> if single quoted (<code>'</code>) strings are present on the line then the
data are <code>character</code> strings 
<LI> else if decimal points (<code>.</code>)  are present then the data is <code>real*8</code>
<LI> else the data is <code>integer </code>
<LI> The number of data entries on the
line specifies the dimension of the array. If only one data entry is
present then the parameter is a scalar (or an array of dimension one
which is equivalent).
</UL></P>

<P>PARAM library: 

<P>The library utilizes Fortran 90 interface blocks in
such a way that the type of parameters (i.e. <code>integer, real*8,
character</code>) is recognized automatically, so the the names of
subroutines are the same for all types. If the dimension of the
parameter is given then it is treated as an array. If dimension is
omitted then it is a scalar. Beware that Fortran 90 treats scalars
and arrays of dimension one differently, so if you confuse them it
may generate an error.</P>

<P>The formal arguments in the subroutines below are: 
<UL>
  <LI> <code>name</code> - <code>character*(*)</code> - the name of the parameter which is a
       character string no longer than 32 bytes 
  <LI> <code>value</code> - a scalar variable or a linear array of type: <code>integer,
       real*8,character*1 to character*16</code>
  <LI> <code>dim</code> - <code>integer</code> - dimension of an array, should be omitted for
       scalars 
  <LI> <code>opt</code> - <code>character*1</code> - an optional &quot;option&quot; (<code>opt='o'</code>
       means &quot;overwrite&quot;) 
  <LI> <code>kunut</code> - <code>integer</code> - unit number for reading/writing 
  <LI> <code>flag</code> - <code>logical</code> - reading &quot;overwrite&quot; option
</UL>
</P>

<P>Simple copy routines to copy parameters to/from database:
<UL>
  <LI><code>set_param( name, value, dim, opt )</code> - put a parameter with the name
       &lt;name&gt; and the value &lt;value&gt; to the database
  <LI><code>get_param( name, value, dim )</code> - copy the value of the parameter
       &lt;name&gt; from the database to the variable &lt;value&gt;
</UL>
<P>These functions will check if the parameter is present in the
database and will generate an error if you are trying to get
parameter which is not in the database or if you are trying to set
parameter which is already set. If you really need to overwrite
parameter which is already in the database use opt='o'. Otherwise
&lt;opt&gt; should be omitted.</P>

<P>Query logical function:
<UL>
  <LI><code>is_set_param( name )</code> - returns <code>.true.</code> if parameter &lt;name&gt; is
       present in the database, <code>.false.</code> otherwise 
</UL></P>

<P>A convenient function which is a combination of those above:
<code>sync_param( name, value, dim )</code> - literally consists of the following
lines:</P>
<P><pre>
      if( is_set_param( name ) ) then
        get_param( name, value, dim ) 
      else
        set_param( name, value, dim )
      endif
</pre>

<P>So what it does, it checks if parameter &lt;name&gt; is in
database and if so copies it to the &lt;value&gt;. Otherwise it
leaves &lt;value&gt; unchanged and copies it to the database with the
name &lt;name&gt;. This function is provided as a convenient tool,
since this is what you will do most often. At the restart each module
will check if certain parameters were provided in the rundeck or in
the restart file (i.e. they are in the database already) and use
those values. If not then it will use default values and will also
copy them to the database so that they are saved to the restart file
for future reference.</P>

<P>Subroutines to work with pointers:</P>

<P><code>alloc_param( name, pvalue, initval, dim )</code> - allocates space in the
database for the parameter &lt;name&gt;, fills it with data provided
in &lt;initval&gt; and returns pointer to it in &lt;pvalue&gt;</P>
<P><code>get_pparam( name, pvalue, dim )</code> - returns pointer &lt;pvalue&gt;
to the parameter data of the parameter &lt;name&gt; in the database</P>

<P>These functions are provided as an additional tool and actually
are not needed if parameters in the database are treated as
&quot;parameters&quot;, i.e. they are set only once at the beginning
of the run and then used as constants. But it appeared that some data
which was in &quot;parameters&quot; common block was changed during
the run (some actually quite often and in different places). To keep
the parameter database up-to-date with those changes one would have
to call &quot;set_param&quot; each time after the data is changed
which is rather awkward. Instead one can use pointers to the
parameter data in the database. Pointers in Fortran 90 are nothing
else but aliases of the objects they point to. So if you get a
pointer to a parameter from the database and then work with it as if
it were a regular variable, you will automatically update it in the
database and there will be no need to call &quot;set_param&quot;. So
this subroutines can be used if one wants to keep a dynamic variable
in the database (so that it is automatically saved to the restart
file).</P>

<P>Reading/writing subroutines:</P>
<P><code>read_param( kunit, ovrwrt )</code> - reads the parameter database from
the unit &lt;kunit&gt;</P>
<P><code>write_param( kunit )</code> - writes the parameter database to the unit
&lt;kunit&gt;</P>
<P>The arguments: 
<ul>
<li><code>kunit</code> - <code>integer</code> - the unit number from/to
reading/writing is performed 
<li><code>ovrwrt</code> - logical - if .true. then
reading overwrites those parameters that are already in the database.
If .false. then those parameters which are already in the database
are left unchanged and only new parameters are added.
</ul>

<P>Other useful subroutines:</P>
<P><code>print_param( kunit )</code> - does formatted output to the unit &lt;kunit&gt;
in a way similar to namelist</P>
<P>The argument: 
<ul>
<li><code>kunit</code> - <code>integer, inetnt(in)</code> - the unit number
corresponding to the file to which we want print the database
</ul>
<P><code>query_param( n, name, dim, ptype )</code> - returns the the information
about the parameter by its number in the database &lt;n&gt;. It
returns 'EMPTY' in the &lt;name&gt; if parameter with such &lt;n&gt;
doesn't exist (i.e. if &lt;n&gt; is bigger then the number of
parameters)</P>
<P>The name is always converted to the low case. It
returns 'EMPTY' (upper case) if &lt;n&gt; doesn't correspond to any
parameter
<ul>
<li><code>dim</code> - <code>integer, intent(out)</code> - returns the dimension of the
parameter (i.e. &lt;dim&gt; = 1 for scalars, &lt;dim&gt; &gt; 1 for
arrays) 
<li><code>ptype</code> - <code>character*1, intent(out)</code> - returns the type of the
parameter: <code>'i'</code> - for <code>integer 'r'</code> - for <code>real*8 
'c'</code> - for <code>character</code></P>
</ul>
<P>Parser subroutine:</P>
<P><code>parse_params( kunit )</code> - parse the information in the file &lt;kunit&gt;
and load the parameters into the database. It overwrites the existing
parameters.</P>
<P>The argument: 
<ul>
<li><code>kunit</code> - <code>integer</code> - the unit number corresponding to
the file with the rundeck information (it should contain a block
starting with &amp;&amp;PARAMETERS and ending with &amp;&amp;END_PARAMETERS)</P>
</ul>
<P>This subroutine is actually located in a separate module PARSER,
but it seemed logical to describe it here.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q2_6"> 6) Any examples?</P>

<P>Here is an example of typical usage of &quot;query_param&quot;.
One should keep in mind that though &quot;get_param&quot; is a
generic interface one should call it with the arguments of correct
type to extract the information. That's why one needs to use &quot;select
case&quot; below.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Q3"><b> 3. FAQs about Preprocessing instructions.</b></a></H3>

<P><A NAME="Q3_1"><b>1) What is preprocessing?</b></a></P>

<P>The preprocessor is a program that runs before the actual compiler 
starts and does certain editing to the source code according to
preprocessing instructions. All preprocessing instructions start with
# in the first column. The most typical example of preprocessor usage
in Fortran code would be:</P>

<pre>
      ...............
      some fortran code
      ..............
#ifdef OPTION_A
      ...............
      fortran code specific for OPTION_A
      ..............
#endif
      ..............
      more fortran code
      ..............
</pre>

<P>In the above example the code between <tt>#ifdef OPTION_A</tt>
and <tt>#endif</tt> will be taken into account only if the name
<tt>OPTION_A</tt> was defined (with the instruction <tt> #define
OPTION_A</tt>) somewhere earlier in the file. Otherwise it will be
treated as commented out. So preprocessor allows you to optionally
include/exclude certain parts of the code. There are also other
useful preprocessing commands, like name substitution. Though with
name substitutions one should be very careful in fixed format
Fortran, since it is easy to create a line which after substitutions
will be longer then 72 characters. The following is a list of typical
preprocessing instructions:
<tt> #define #undef #include #ifdef #ifndef
#if #else #endif </tt>
SGI manual pages provide good explanations to those
instructions. On SGI type <tt>man cpp</tt>.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q3_2"><b>2) How to set up global preprocessing options in a
rundeck?</b></a></P>

<P>Your rundeck may contain an optional block which starts with a
line <em>Preprocessor Options</em> and ends with a line <em>End
Preprocessor Options</em>. Everything between those lines is treated
as a set of preprocessing definitions and will be included into
corresponding source files. Here is a simple example of preprocessing
block:</P> 
<pre>
Preprocessor Options
#define TRACERS_ON ! include tracers code
End Preprocessor Options
</pre>
<P>It defines the name <tt>TRACERS_ON</tt>. The text which starts
from <tt>'!'</tt> is considered as comment and is ignored. Trailing spaces and
empty lines are also ignored.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q3_3"><b> 3) How to use global preprocessing options in a
source file?</b></a></P>

<P>If you want to use global preprocessing options in a certain
source file you should include a line:</P>

<tt>#include &quot;rundeck_opts.h&quot;</tt></BR>

<P>
at the very beginning of such file. Otherwise all global
preprocessing names will stay undefined (the compiler will not give any
warnings about this). A typical use of a preprocessing option would
be: </P>
<pre>
#include &quot;rundeck_opts.h&quot;
      .......... some code
#ifdef TRACERS_ON
      some tracers code here
#endif
      some code
</pre>

<P>The code between <tt>#ifdef TRACERS_ON</tt> and <tt>#endif</tt>
will be included only when global name <tt>TRACERS_ON</tt> is defined in a
rundeck. Otherwise this code will be ignored by the compiler.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q3_4"><b> 4) How does it work?</b></a></P>

<P>When the Makefile starts to compile the model it reads the global
preprocessing options block from the rundeck and compares it to the
contents of the file <tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt>. If they are
identical the file <tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt> is left unchanged.
Otherwise it is overwritten with the new preprocessing block. File
<tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt> should be included into each source file
which wants to use global preprocessing options. This is done by
putting a line</P>
<tt>#include &quot;rundeck_opts.h&quot;</tt>
<P>in the beginning of the source file. Note that one should use CPP
include (i.e. <tt>#include</tt>, which starts from the first
position), and not the Fortran <tt>include</tt>. When the Makefile
checks dependencies it takes into account dependency on
<tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt>, so that when <tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt> is changed
all files which <tt>#include</tt> it are automatically recompiled.</P>

<P><A NAME="Q3_5"><b> 5) Any recommendations on usage?</b></a></P>

<P>There is an understanding that global preprocessing options should
be used only when there is no other convenient way to reach the same
goal. One should keep in mind that once the global preprocessing
block in a rundeck is changed, all files that include
<tt>rundeck_opts.h</tt> will be recompiled which most probably 
will force the recompile of the entire model. So one should limit
such options to those which would not change too often from rundeck
to rundeck. This functionality is introduced mainly for the options
which are global (i.e. used in many source files at the same time)
and which need to be documented (that's why this block is in a
rundeck). Typical example would be an option which controls inclusion
of tracers code into the model (as in example above). There is also a
general convention that the names defined by preprocessor are
constructed of capital letters only with '_' introduced for
readability, like: <tt>USE_OPTION_A</tt> . I suggest that we
observe it. This helps to distinguish them from the rest of the code
which is usually in lower case. And yes, names used by preprocessor
are case-sensitive (unlike names in Fortran).</P>
