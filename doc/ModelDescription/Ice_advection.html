<H3>Ice advection</H3>

<p> Ice advection is a function of the atmosphere-ice and ice-ocean
momentum stress and the sea surface gradient. The internal ice
pressures and rheology are estimated using the Flato-Hibler
viscous-plastic rheology as coded by Zhang and Rothrock, 1999. Due to
the requirement that the surface type fractions don't vary over the
surface flux calculation we calculate the ice velocities and ice-ocean
momentum stress at the beginning of the calculation (in DYNSI), but
the ice mass fluxes are not applied until afterwards (in ADVSI). The
advection is done using the linear upstream scheme in the two
horizontal directions. This code is turned on by using the 
ICEDYN_DRV ICEDYN modules instead of the ICEDYN_DUM module, and works with 
any ocean configuration. </p>

<p> In the fixed SST case, using the ice advection does not change the
ice variables, but does allow the ice and energy convergences due to
advection to be calculated, nad subsequently used in the the q-flux
model. The q-fluxes need to be consistent with the ice advection, and
so if ICEDYN_DRV ICEDYN is used in the spin-up, it must also be used
in the q-flux model (and vice versa).</p>
