<H3>Q-flux (mixed layer) model</H3>

<P>We can calculate the total freshwater mass and heat fluxes into the
ice/ocean component from a spin up run with fixed SST. Given a
climatology of ocean mixed layer depths, we can calculate the implied
ocean heat convergence at the base of the mixed layer. This will
incorporate the actual ocean heat transports, but also a residual
component related to any errors in the surface heat or mass fluxes.
This ocean heat convergence can be input into a thermodynamic mixed
layer to give a Q-flux model. Depending on whether ice advection is
turned on (see <a href="#part4_2">above</a>), the horizontal transport
of the sea ice is or is not incorporated into the ocean heat
convergence. A full sea  ice thermodynamic calculation is performed
for this model. Generally this model takes 20 to 30 years to come into
thermal equilibrium with any change in forcing, but this can be
changed by specifying the maximum mixed layer depth (smaller implies a
faster equilibration).</P>

<P> There is an option to allow diffusion into the deep ocean by
replacing OCNML with ODEEP in the run deck. This requires a 10 year
spin up of the Q-flux model in order to properly set the deeper layers
(12 layers, down to 5000m).</P>
