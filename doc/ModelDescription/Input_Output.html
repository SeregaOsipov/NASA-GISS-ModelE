<H3>Input/Output</H3>

<P>Apart from boundary condition files that are controlled by
individual modules, restart file input and output is controlled by
<TT>IORSF</TT>. This is a driver
routine that calls individual <TT>io_XYZ</TT>
routines for each module. This allows different versions of each
module to control the I/O of the required prognostic variables.
Depending on the value of <TT>iaction</TT>
in the call, different kinds of I/O can be set (read or write, double
or single precision, with or without tracers, with diagnostics or
not).
