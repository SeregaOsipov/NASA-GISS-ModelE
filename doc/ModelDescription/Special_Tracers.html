<H3>Special Tracers</H3>

<p>Some special tracer physics come as standard in the model. These
relate to tracers that are of special interest to some of the
developers.</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>#define TRACERS_SPECIAL_O18</tt> sets up special
       physics for water isotopes. It requires <tt>#define TRACERS_ON</tt>
       and <tt>#define TRACERS_WATER</tt> to be set as well, and that
       <tt>TRACERS_O18</tt> be included in the object modules.
  <li><tt>#define TRACERS_SPECIAL_Lerner</tt> tracers for looking at
       stratospheric/tropospheric exchange.
</ul>
