<H3>Rivers</H3>

<p> Rivers exist in all land grid boxes and collect runoff from the
soil and land ice models. Where there is a lake fraction, the water is
considered a lake (as above). Where there is not, there is no
intereaction with the atmosphere. Tranpsort of river water depends on
the (fixed) downstream direction file and mean slope, and the depth of
the upstream river/lake above a predefined sill depth. Some boxes do
not contain an outlet, and so can accumulate water indefinitely. As
the river water reaches an ocean box, the water is deposited uniformly
within that box. </p>
