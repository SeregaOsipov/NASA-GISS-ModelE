<H3>Ground Hydrology</H3>

<p> The soils are modelled separately for bare and vegetated
soil. Additionally, there is a canopy layer over the vegetated
portion. The soils are modelled using 6 variable depth
layers. Evapotransiration takes water from the surface pools, and from
below as a function of rooting depths. Runoff is calculated using a
TOPmodel approach.

<H4>Just testing MathJax system here</H4>

<P>
Here is an example of in-line  formula: $W_i = x$
and here is a formula on a separate line:
$$
a^{i,j} = \sqrt{a \over b}
$$
