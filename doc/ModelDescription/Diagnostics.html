<H3>Diagnostics</H3>

<P>Almost all diagnostics in the model are accumulated and only
averaged in the post-processing (or for the end of month printout).
Budget page diagnostics are accumulated in the relevant (atmospheric
or sea ice) routines, along with relevant atmospheric lat-lon diags.
Constant pressure lat-height diagnostics are only calculated in
<TT>DIAGA</TT>, called from within
<TT>DYNAM</TT>.  Calculation and print
out of the diagnostics is done from print_diags.
