<H3>Surface fluxes</H3>

<p> Surface fluxes are calculated separately for each land surface
 type (open water, ice, earth and land ice). For each type, a different
 high resolution PBL calculation is done to extrapolate the first layer
 atmospheric properties to the surface (defined as 10m above the
 ground). The diffusion parameters in the PBL layers are functions of
 the local turbulence closure scheme
 (Hartke and Rind, 1997; Cheng et al, 2002) and are
 iterated to get a robust estimate of the surface properties
 (temperature, humidity, and tracer concentration) and
 fluxes. Generally, 2 or 4 surface flux time steps are done every hour,
 depending on the vertical resolution.
 Between the surface and the middle of the first GCM layer,
 instead of applying the usual interpolation scheme
 using the similarity laws,  the model integrates closure equations
 for velocity, potential temperature, humidity and other scalars over
 the subgrid levels, to find their surface values.
 This procedure, which is unique among the GCMs,
 is convenient for adding more physics and allows coarse vertical
 resolutions near the surface.
