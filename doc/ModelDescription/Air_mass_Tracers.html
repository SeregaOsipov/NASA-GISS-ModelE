<H3>Air mass Tracers</H3>

<p>The code for tracers of mass transport in the atmosphere is
initialised by setting <tt>#define TRACERS_ON</tt> in the rundeck.
These tracers are mostly insoluble gases or ideal tracers such as air
mass age or source. All changes in air mass (by advection, convection,
the sea level pressure filter) and parameterised mixing (stratospheric
diffusion, atmospheric turbulence) are followed by the tracers. There
is one exception for the pure 'Air' tracer: this must follow the mass
field identically, but during the operation of the sea level pressure
filter, a conservation of mass implies a change in concentration. For
most tracers, conservation of mass is more important, but for 'Air'
concentration is conserved.
