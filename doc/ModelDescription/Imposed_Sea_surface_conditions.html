<H3>Imposed Sea surface conditions</H3>

<P> The simplest ocean model is one where the sea surface temperature
is read in from a file, either a fixed (annually repeating)
climatology, or a transient (monthly varying) realisation based on
observations or previous simulations. Monthly means and end of month
values are read in and a quadratic approximation used to interpolate
to the (fixed) daily value at every grid point. This is constructed to
ensure that the monthly mean of the daily interpolated values is equal
to the specified mean. Along with SST, the sea ice concentration is
also a required field. This is interpolated similarly but is
constructed so that the minimum and maximum values are respected. Sea
ice thickness is also fixed in these cases, but given the lack of
reliable global observations, we set this based on a local scaling to
the sea ice concentration. However, if the sea surface conditions come
from the output of a coupled model simulation, sea ice thickness can
be provided as an input, by using the ZSI file, which is interpolated
similarly.</P>
