<H3>Stratospheric processes</H3>

<p> Stratopsheric drag is applied in two ways. Firstly, using a simple
formulation as a Rayleigh damping near the top of the model (SDRAG).
Secondly, and generally only if the stratsophere is being properly
resolved, we have a physically-based estimate of gravity-wave drag
detemined from the model simulation of moist convection, mountain
waves, shear and deformation (in STRATDYN) (Rind et al, 1988). When
gravity waves break, there is also some vertical mixing associated
with that. Both GWDRAG and SDRAG are applied within the dynamical leap
frog tiome steps to improve stability.</p>
