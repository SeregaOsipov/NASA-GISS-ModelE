<H3>Turbulence and Dry convection</H3>

<p> There are two methods of vertical mixing outside of the surface
layer: Complete mixing is performed if two boxes are statically
unstable (using the virtual potential temperature) (DRYCNV); otherwise a
turbulence closure is used to estimate the amount of mixing based on
the grid-scale properties and available TKE (ATURB). </p>
<P>
Turbulence effectively transfers heat, moisture, and momentum between the surface and the lower atmosphere,
 and modifies the atmospheric stability and vertical distributions of these quantities.
In earlier GISS GCMs, dry convective adjustment (using DRYCNV.f instead of ATURB_E1.f or ATURB.f, in the rundeck) 
 was applied to perform the role of turbulence (Hansen et al. 1983).
Since the 1990's turbulence scheme (second order closure scheme plus semi-empirical scheme)
have been implemented in the GISS GCM. There are two versions of the turbulence scheme
currently in use. The older version is contained in ATURB_E1,f, the newer version is in ATURB.f. 
They are characterized by:
  1) a nonlocal vertical transport scheme for virtual potential temperature,
  specific humidity, and other scalars following Holtslag and Moeng (1991) in ATURB_E1.f, and following
  Holtslag and Boville (1993) in ATURB.f; 
  2) employment of the second-order closure (SOC) scheme of Cheng et al. (2002) 
  that improves several aspects of the standard Mellor-Yamada model (Mellor and Yamada 1982) 
  and in particular, allows mixing at weak turbulence levels (Canuto et al., 2008); 
  3) diagnosis and use of the nonlocal
  vertical profile of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) according to the large eddy simulation (LES)
  studies of Moeng and Sullivan (1994); 
  4) a formulation of the turbulence length scale that is similar to (in ATURB_E1.f), or 
  a generalization of (in ATURB.f), that of  Holtslag and Boville (1993); ATURB.f also 
  employs  a length scale formula for different stabilities by 
   Nakanishi(2001) based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) data;
  5) calculation of the PBL height using the TKE criterion (in ATURB_E1.f),
   or the bulk Richardson number criterion (in ATURB.f).
  ATURB.f has significant improvements in cloud and radiation simulations,
   especially over the subtropical eastern oceans and the southern oceans, over ATURB_E1.f,
   while the latter yields deeper vertical transports of heat and moisture in the
   tropics (Yao and Cheng, 2012).
