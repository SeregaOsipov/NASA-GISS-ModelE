<H3>Soluble and Water mass Tracers</H3>

<p> If the tracer interacts with the hydrologic cycle the preprocessor
directive <tt>#define TRACERS_WATER</tt> should be set in the rundeck
in addition to <tt>#define TRACERS_ON</tt>. This allows for a separate
tracer budget in all water reservoirs (cloud liquid water,
precipitation, sea ice, lakes, ground water, glaciers and oceans (if
a non-trivial ocean model is used)). There can be complicated
interactions in the clouds between the in air and in water tracers,
and any tracer amount in precip is followed through it's subsequent
travels. These tracers are useful for soluble gases and water tracers
themselves (isotopes, age, source).</p>
