<H3>Installing NetCDF library in your computer</H3>
<p>
On Linux and Mac OS X machines typically you can install NetCDF from
the main software repositories (with &quot;yum&quot; or similar
package manage on Linux or MacPorts on Mac). You can try it, but we
don't recommend this approach. The problem is that for a library to be
compatible with your Fortran compiler it has to be compiled with the
same compiler and with the same flags you will be using and that may
be not the case when you get a precompiled library from a repository. 
If you install NetCDF with MacPorts, at least make sure that you have
installed the Fortran compiler before you start the installation of
NetCDF and that MacPorts recognizes it as a default compiler.
</p>
<p>
The safer way, though, is to install NetCDF from the source code. You
can download the gzipped tar file with the source code from 
<pre>
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp
</pre>
To install it do the following. Untar the downloaded file and enter
the directory with downloaded code:
<pre>
tar -xzf netcdf-3.6.3.tar.gz
cd netcdf-3.6.3
</pre>
Choose a directory where you want to install NetCDF, say
&quot;/opt/netcdf/3.6.3&quot; (make sure that directory above it
exists and is writable to you). Make sure that Fortran compiler is
installed and is functional. Now, start the installation process.
<p>
Inform the system which Fortran compiler you are going to use
<pre>
export FC=gfortran
</pre>
Configure the package giving it the desired location for installation
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/opt/netcdf/3.6.3
</pre>
Compile and install the package
<pre>
make
make install
</pre>
Netcdf library should now be functional on your system. To inform
modelE about its location you need to add the following line to your
<code>~/.modelErc</code> file:
<pre>
NETCDFHOME=/opt/netcdf/3.6.3
</pre>
