<H3>Getting the code form GISS repository</H3>
<p>
The source code for modelE is stored in a repository on 
<A HREF="http://simplex.giss.nasa.gov"> simplex.giss.nasa.gov </A>
under control of the Git version control system. If you are a modelE
developer and need a full write access to the repository please click 
<A HREF="https://simplex.giss.nasa.gov/giss/"> here </A> for
instructions on how to get it. Once you set up your access to simplex,
you can get modelE source code (&quot;clone&quot; the repository) with
<pre>
git clone username_on_sumplex@simplex.giss.nasa.gov:/giss/gitrepo/modelE.git
</pre>
where <code>username_on_sumplex</code> is your username on simplex.
<p>
If you are an active user (or a developer who doesn't need a write
access) and you need a read access to the repository for automatic
updates of your code, you can use an HTTP access to the repository. 
You still need a web password for simplex to use it (contact modelE
core development team to get one). Once you have a password you can
clone the modelE source code with</p>
<pre>
GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://simplex.giss.nasa.gov/gitrepo/modelE.git modelE_foo
</pre>
(may not work with older version of Git).
<p>
Finally, if you are a regular user who works only with
&quot;stable&quot; releases of the model or who wants to try the
latest snapshot of the development code, but doesn't need an
interactive communication with the repository, you can download 
the tar file of the modelE source code form</p>
