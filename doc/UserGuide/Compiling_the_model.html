<H3>Compiling the model and setting up a directory for model run</H3>

<P>
Compilation of the model and preparation of a directory for the model
run is performed by combination of make and perl scripts. They are
designed to automatically detect model configuration and resolve
dependencies between Fortran modules. Typical user would never need to
modify any of these scripts. 
<P>
Typical command for compiling the model and setting up a directory for
model run is
<pre>
     make setup RUN=&lt;RunID&gt;
</pre>
This command will read model configuration from
<code>&lt;RunID&gt;.R</code> rundeck and compile the corresponding
executable. It will also create a directory for the run and link it to
the current directory with the name <code>&lt;RunID&gt;</code>. The
executable will be put into this run directory 
together with all the scripts which are needed to run the model. 
This command compiles the model for serial run. If one wants to
compile the model for parallel run (using MPI) one has to append a
flag <code>MPI=YES</code> on the command line, i.e.
<pre>
     make setup RUN=&lt;RunID&gt; MPI=YES
</pre>
<P>
Normally, once the model is compiled and before you start a long run,
you want to perform a &quot;cold start&quot;, i.e. you want to start
your simulations from initial conditions, run the model for 1 hour of
model time and save its state into a checkpoint file (restart file). 
This can be done with a command
<pre>
    ../exec/runE &lt;RunID&gt; -np &lt;NP&gt; -cold-restart
</pre>
where <code>&lt;NP&gt;</code> is the number of MPI threads you want to
use (typically the number of available cpu cores). Keep in mind that
on big computers you may not be allowed to run MPI jobs
interactively. In this case you have to set a variable QSUB_STRING
in your ~/.modelErc file to a command which would submit your task as
a batch job (see next section). Once first-hour run finishes
successfully your model is ready for longer runs. 
<P>
If you really want to, you can request <code>make</code> to
automatically run the model for the first hour after it finishes the
setup. To do this use the target &quot;setup-run&quot; instead of
&quot;setup&quot;, i.e.
<pre>
    make setup-run RUN=&lt;RunID&gt; MPI=YES NPES=&lt;NP&gt;
</pre>
where <code>&lt;NP&gt;</code> is the number of MPI threads for the
first hour run.
<P>
Typically <code>make</code> resolves dependencies well when code
changes and recompiles only those files which have to be recompiled. 
But when one switches to a completely different rundeck or checks out
a different branch from the git repository, it may be safer to delete
all precompiled object files and start a fresh compilation. To do it
just execute
<pre>
    make clean
</pre>
before starting a new compilation.
<P>
If for some reason you want to compile the model, but don't want to
set up a run directory you can do it by using a target
&quot;gcm&quot; instead of &quot;setup&quot;.
