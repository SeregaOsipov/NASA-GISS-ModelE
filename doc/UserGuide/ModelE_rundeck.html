<H3>ModelE rundeck</H3>

<P>
A rundeck (a file with an extension .R) is a file which contains
a complete description of a particular model run, including 
the description of model code used and run-time parameters. 
Directory modelE/templates contains typical rundecks which 
can be used as examples.
</P>

<H4>Rundeck structure</H4>

<P>
Rundeck consists of a number of sections describing different
aspects of the run. Each section starts with certain keywords
(like "Object modules:") and terminates either with "End ..." 
statement or with the start of a new section. The sections 
are supposed to follow in a pre-defined order and can't be
interchanged, though some unneeded sections can be skipped. 
The character ! starts a comment. Everything to the right of ! 
until the end of the line is ignored. Here is the list 
of rundeck sections in proper order:
<UL>
 <LI> Run name and comment
 <LI> Preprocessor Options
 <LI> Run Options
 <LI> Object modules
 <LI> Components
 <LI> Component Options
 <LI> Data input files
 <LI> Label and Namelist
 <LI> Run-time parameters
 <LI> Restart and timing parameters
</UL>
Any text after the last section is considered a comment and is
ignored.
</P>

<H4>Run name and comment</H4>

<P>
The first line of this section should start from the name of
this rundeck (including .R) and contain short information on the 
run (no more than 80 characters). The rest of this section is 
a comment.
</P>

<H4>Preprocessor Options</H4>

<P>
Starts with the line
<pre>
Preprocessor Options
</pre>
and ends with the line
<pre>
End Preprocessor Options
</pre>
This section should contain all preprocessing definitions you 
want to be set in the code. Keep in mind that these preprocessing
options are passed by means of creating a file rundeck_opts.h 
which is included from the source files. When adding preprocessing
instructions to a source file one should make sure that rundeck_opts.h
is included at the start of this file.
</P>

<H4>Run Options</H4>

<P>
Starts with the line
<pre>
Run Options
</pre>
This section contains options for setting a proper environment 
before startting a model run. Only one option is currently supported:
<pre>
STACKSIZE=stack size in KB>
</pre>
which sets a corresponding stack size. Currenlly if the default stack
size is bigger than the one requested this option is <LI>ignored.


<H4>Object modules</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
Object modules:
</pre>
This section lists all the source files from modelE/model which 
have to be compiled with current executable. Only basename of
these files should be given (no suffix). If more than one source
file with the same basename is present in modelE/model directory
the search is done in the following order: *.f, *.F90, *.c .
For each source file one can specify individual compilation 
options which will be appended to the compilation command. These
options are specified between "||" after the file name, for
example " MODELE |-O0 -g| " . The files located inside "Components"
should not be listed in this section.


<H4>Components</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
Components:
</pre>
This section lists all "Components" (the subdirectories of
modelE/model) which have to be compiled with the executable. Keep in
mind that each Component will be compiled into a library which will be
then linked with the main executable. As a result in a case of a name
conflict (more than one subroutine with the same name is present) the
preference will be given to the one located in modelE/model
directory. 


<H4>Component Options</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
Component Options:
</pre>
This section lists specific options which have to be passed to certain
components. For each Component the options are listed on a single line
as follows
<pre>
OPTS_&ltComponentName&gt = &ltOpt1&gt=&ltX&gt &ltOpt2&gt=&ltY&gt
</pre>
where Opt1, Opt2 are variabes to be set and X, Y are corresponding
values. The instruction above is equivalent to setting Opt1=X, Opt2=Y
at the start of <tt>&ltComponentName&gt</tt> Makefile. 

There is a special debugging option OVERWRITE_FSRCS which can be
passed to any component (which uses base.mk). If this option is set to
a list of source files, these files will be used when compiling the
component (instead of the ones specified inside the component
Makefile). The use of this option is discouraged for the production
runs though (which should use the source files specified by the
component itself). Similar option OVERWRITE_F90SRCS can be used to
specify F90 files.


<H4>Data input files</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
Data input files:
</pre>
This section lists all the input files used by the current
executable. The files are listed in the form
<pre>
&ltshort_name&gt=&ltpath to the actual file&gt
</pre>
where &ltshort_name&gt is the name of the file used in the code and
&ltpath to the actual file&gt is the path to the actual input file. The
pass is specified with respect to GCMSEARCHPATH directory, unless it
starts with "/" in which case it is an absolute path.
</P>

<H4>Label and Namelist</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
Label and Namelist:
</pre>
And consists of a single line which starts with the name of the
run which is followed by a short description.

This section may follow by (now obsolete) instruction
<pre>
DTFIX=&lttime_step&gt
</pre>
where &lttime_step&gt is a fall-back time step (s) which the model should
use if it discovers internal instability.
</P>

<H4>Run-time parameters</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
&&PARAMETERS
</pre>
and ends with a line
<pre>
&&END_PARAMETERS
</pre>
This section contains all run-time parameters which have to be passed
to the model. Parameters shoud be listed one per line in the form
<pre>
&ltparam_name&gt=&ltparam_value&gt
</pre>
where &ltparam_name&gt is the name of the parameter as it is used in the
model code. &ltparam_value&gt is its numerical value. In case of an array
&ltparam_value&gt is a coma-separated list of values. Values should be of
the same type as the parameter they are assigned to (as it is declared
in the model code).
</P>

<H4>Restart and timing parameters</H4>

<P>
Starts with a line
<pre>
 &INPUTZ
</pre>
This section contains the fortran namelist for the timing and restart
parameters. By default these should be set to start the model from
some kind of initial conditions and run it for one hour of model time 
(for "make setup ...").
</P>
