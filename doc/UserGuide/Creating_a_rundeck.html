<H3>Creating a rundeck</H3>

<P>
Each modelE run is completely described by a configuration file 
which we call a &quot;rundeck&quot;. 
<P>
A rundeck can be created by copying an existing rundeck to a file with
a different name and then modifying it. One can also create a typical
rundeck for a particular configuration from one of the provided
templates (files modelE/templates/*.R). To create a rundeck from a
template just execute
<pre>
    make rundeck RUN=&lt;RunID&gt; RUNSRC=&lt;Template&gt;
</pre>
where <code>&lt;RunID&gt;</code> is the name of the new rundeck and 
<code>&lt;Template&gt;</code> is the name of a template (both
without <code>.R</code>).
<P>
When rundeck is created a copy of it is saved for permanent storage in
&quot;decks repository&quot; under ModelE_Support. This is done so
that one could always find the rundeck used for a particular
production simulation even long time after this simulation was done. 
As a result the system will not allow you to create a rundeck with the
name which is already present in the repository. If you don't need
this stored rundeck and want to overwrite it with a new one just
specify OVERWRITE=YES on command line, i.e.
<pre>
    make rundeck RUN=&lt;RunID&gt; RUNSRC=&lt;Template&gt; OVERWRITE=YES
</pre>

<P>
See next chapter for a detailed description of modelE rundeck.
