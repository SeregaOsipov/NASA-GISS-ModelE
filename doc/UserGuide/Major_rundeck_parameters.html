<H3>Major rundeck parameters</H3>

<p>
A number of parameters are critical in setting up a simulation via the rundeck.
These include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#year">Definition of the year(s) to be simulated</a>
</ul>

<h4><a name="year">Definition of the year(s) to be simulated</a></h4>

<p>In order to select which year to simulate, the variable <tt>master_yr</tt>
must be defined in the rundeck. The model will not run without it. This
variable can equal to a) the numerical year of simulation, e.g.
<tt>master_yr=1850</tt> where the year in question will be repeated for
every simulation year, or b) <tt>master_yr=0</tt> where the model
will perform a transient simulation, starting from the year defined by
the variable <tt>YEARI</tt> in the rundeck and ending at the year defined by
<tt>YEARE</tt>. The year currently being simulated in the model code can be
accessed via the variable <tt>JYEAR</tt>.</p>

<p>One can run a simulation with mixed year configurations. When this is
the case, <tt>master_yr</tt> defines the basic configuration, and several
other variables declare the deviations from the <tt>master_yr</tt> setting.
Similar with the <tt>master_yr</tt> case, they can either take the numeric
value of a specific year that will be repeated every year, or the value zero,
meaning a transient simulation. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>aero_yr</tt>: Tropospheric aerosol distribution year for radiation.
      This applies when aerosols and radiation are not coupled, or for
      non-tracer simulations.
  <li><tt>aer_int_yr</tt>: Aerosol emissions year.
  <li><tt>albsn_yr</tt>: Year of BC deposition used for snow albedo.
  <li><tt>crops_yr</tt>: Crops distribution year.
  <li><tt>ghg_yr</tt>: Greenhouse gases concentrations year.
  <li><tt>o3_yr</tt>: O3 precursor emissions year.
  <li><tt>s0_yr</tt>: Solar constant year.
  <li><tt>volc_yr</tt>: Stratospheric volcanic aerosol year. Other options
      are: -1, for a 150-year mean (1850-1999); -2010, for the current year
      up to 2010 and then repeat volcanoes from 100 years ago; -2000, for
      using the old way of creating future volcanoes.
  <li><tt>orb_par_year_bp</tt>: Offset from 1950 for orbital calculations
      when a single year is being repeated in every simulated year (case
      <tt>variable_orb_par=0</tt>; see next point), or zero for transient.
  <li><tt>variable_orb_par</tt>: Equals to 0 for constant orbital parameters,
      1 for transient orbital parameters. Other options are -1, where orbital
      parameters from the rundeck (variable <tt>orb_par</tt>) are being used,
      and -2 for selecting the in-code orb_par defaults.
  <li><tt>PI_run</tt>: Equals to 1 for a preindustrial (year 1850) simulation,
      and to 0 otherwise. This sets scaling factors of initial conditions
      for long-lived gases taken from the rundeck (<tt>PIratio_XXXX</tt>).
  <li><tt>aircraft_Tyr1</tt>: Define the first year of data in the aircraft
      emissions file. If <tt>aircraft_Tyr1</tt> == <tt>aircraft_Tyr2</tt>,
      the file is assumed to not be transient.
  <li><tt>aircraft_Tyr2</tt>: Define the first year of data in the aircraft
      emissions file. If <tt>aircraft_Tyr1</tt> == <tt>aircraft_Tyr2</tt>,
      the file is assumed to not be transient.
  <li><tt>biomass_Tyr1</tt>: Define the first year of data in the biomass
      emissions file. If <tt>biomass_Tyr1</tt> == <tt>biomass_Tyr2</tt>,
      the file is assumed to not be transient.
  <li><tt>biomass_Tyr2</tt>: Define the first year of data in the biomass
      emissions file. If <tt>biomass_Tyr1</tt> == <tt>biomass_Tyr2</tt>,
      the file is assumed to not be transient.
</ul>

<p>In addition to the year definition, three parameters have also day-of-year
definitions. These are the solar constant (<tt>s0_day</tt>), greenhouse
gases (<tt>ghg_day</tt>) and stratospheric volcanic aerosols
(<tt>volc_day</tt>). These can be explicitly defined from the rundeck, or
not. When not defined, they take their default value defined in the model's
code (182 - the middle of the year) or zero when their corresponding
<tt>_yr</tt> value is zero.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this process is NOT smart enough to alter the input
files provided by the used via the rundeck. One should take additional care
in providing to the model the appropriate input files for the desired
simulation (e.g. SST, sea ice, emissions, etc.) via the rundeck.</p>

<p>Consider the following example case:
<pre>
master_yr=0
aero_yr=1850
O3_yr=1850
variable_orb_par=0
orb_par_year_bp=2000
</pre>
Here the model will perform a transient simulation from the year <tt>YEARI</tt>
to the year <tt>YEARE</tt> by using constant aerosol and O3 precursor emissions
from the year 1850, and non-interannually varying orbital parameters from the
year 2000. Note that stratospheric volcanic aerosols will be transient, since
<tt>volc_yr</tt> is not defined, thus it defaults to
<tt>volc_yr=master_yr=0</tt>.</p>
