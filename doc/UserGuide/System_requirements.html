<H3>System requirements</H3>
<p>
The ModelE source code is quite portable and can be installed and used
basically on any Unix machine with enough CPU power and memory (from
Linux clusters to Linux and Mac OS X desktops). Though one can run the
basic serial version of the model with prescribed ocean on a single
core with as little as 2 GB of memory, to do any useful simulations in
reasonable time one would need a computer with at least 16 cores
(Sandy Bridge or faster) with at least 1 GB of memory per core. To do
dynamic ocean simulations with full atmospheric chemistry one
typically would need 88 cores with at least 1 GB of memory per core.
</p>
<p>
The source code is written mostly in Fortran 90 language with some
elements of Fortran 2003 and can be compiled either with Intel <code>ifort</code>
compiler (version 12.0) or with GNU <code>gfortran</code> (version 4.9 or later).
</p>
<p>
For input/output we use a NetCDF library, so it has to be installed
(version 3.6 or later).
</p>
<p>
For parallel simulations on multiple cores the model needs to be
compiled with MPI support, so an MPI library needs to be installed on
your computer. The following MPI distributions are
currently supported by the model: </p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenMPI
  <li>Intel
  <li>MPICH2
  <li>MVAPICH2
  <li>SCALI
  <li>mpt
</ul>
<p>
For desktops or small servers we would recommend OpenMPI, since it is
the easiest one to install and configure, though MPICH2 also works
without problems. On a cluster, typically it would be up to support
group to make a decision on which MPI distribution is more suitable
for a particular platform. Over the last few years we were using Intel
MPI with great success.
</p>
<p>
The compilation process is based on GNU <code>make</code> command and uses <code>perl</code>
scripting language and <code>m4</code> preprocessor (GNU version). Typically these
are present by default on any Linux or Mac OS X system, but if you are
using other type on Unix you may need to install them.
<p>
If instead of latitude-longitude version of the model you want to work
with cubed sphere version, then in addition to the requirements
mentioned above you will need to install a compatible ESMF
library. You will also need to obtain the source code for the cubed
sphere dynamical core from the developers since it is not included in
the standard modelE distribution.
