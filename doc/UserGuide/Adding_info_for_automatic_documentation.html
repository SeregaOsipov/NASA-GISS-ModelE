<H3>Adding information for automatic documentation</H3>

<p>
We are using a special format for adding in-line documentation inside
the modelE source code. This serves two purposes. First, users know
where to look for important information. Second, we are using an
automatic documentation system which can process such specially
formatted comments and generate an online documentation. 

Each line of such comments should start from one of the following
special tags:</p>
<pre>
!@sum     Brief summary/description of the current program unit or file
!@auth    Author (if known)
!@ver     Version (if relevant)
!@var     &lt;name&gt; Describes a variable (in the FORTRAN sense)
!@param   &lt;name&gt; Describes a parameter (in the FORTRAN sense)
!@dbparam &lt;name&gt; Describes a database parameter (in the modelE sense)
!@nlparam &lt;name&gt; Describes a NAMELIST parameter (in the modelE sense)
!@+       Continuation line
</pre>
We require that each module, each subroutine and each function are
given a brief summary which describes their functionality. This should
be done by adding a line immediately after their declaration which
starts from <code>!@sum</code> (written from the first position) and which
provides such description. If description consists of more than one
line a continuation tag <code>!@+</code> should be put at the beginning of
each new line. When author (or authors) is known his/her name should
be included on a line which starts from <code>!@auth</code> and
immediately follows the summary. If the entire module was written
primarily by the same author, it is enough to mention his/her name
at the beginning of the module and not to include it with each
subroutine or function. Version tag <code>!@ver</code> proved to be not
very informative and you don't need to use it unless you have a reason
to explicitly mention the version of a particular piece of code in
the documentation. 

<p>
Each global module variable and each argument in declaration of
function or subroutine should be described using <code>!@var</code> tag. 
This can be done either on a separate line which starts
from <code>!@var</code> immediately followed by the variable name and then
by its description, or one can include a description on the same line
the variable is declared (if declaration contains only one variable). 
In latter case one should not include the variable name
after <code>!@var</code>. The description of each variable should include
its physical units.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of variables for which one has to use different
tags: the ones which are defined in the rundeck in the
&quot;parametes&quot; and namelist sections. These should be described
using <code>!@dbparam</code> and <code>!@nlparam</code> respectively (instead
of <code>!@var</code>).
</p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<pre>
      module ghy
!@sum This module contains ground hydrology routines.
!@+   Most of its functionality is described in Abramopoulos 1988 paper.
!@auth John Smith

!@var asnsh sensible heat accumulated over the time step (J)
      real*8 :: asnsh
!@dbparam max_snow maximal allowed snow thickness from rundeck (m)
      real*8 :: max_snow

      contains
      subroutine advnc(dt, w, ht)
!@sum advances ground prognostic variables one time step
      real*8 :: dt    !@var time step (s)
      real*8 :: w(:)  !@var soil layer water content (m)
      real*8 :: ht(:) !@var soil layer heat content (J)
      ...........................
      end subroutine advnc
      end module ghy
