<h3><A name="part2"><b>Part II: Getting information from the
diagnostics</b></a></h3>

<p><A name="part2_1"><b>1) HOW-TO look at the output</b></a></p>

<p>You can look at the output in two distinct ways: using the run-time
printout, or using the post-processing program, pdE.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <p>The run-time printout.</p>

       <p>If you run the model using 'runE' (as opposed to 'runE -q' which
suppresses the printout) the model will produce a $RUNID.PRT file
which can contain copious amounts of diagnostic information. It is
split into a number of sections: (see next question for a list). This
is produced each month (but can be controlled using the KDIAG switches
and NMONAV in the NAMELIST).</p>

  <li> <p>Post-processed output:</p>
       <p>Each month the program produces an 'acc' accumulated
       diagnostics file which contains all of the diagnostic information from
       the previous month. The program 'pdE' (in the exec directory) is an
       alternate entry point into the model that reads in any number of these
       files and a) creates a printout (as above) for the time period
       concerned and b) creates binary output of many more diagnostics. This
       can be used simply to recreate the monthly printout, but also to
       create longer term means (annual, seasonal, monthly climatologies
       etc.).</p>

       <p>For example, to recreate the printout in /u/cmrun/$RUNID;
       <ul>
  <li>for a single month: pdE $RUNID JAN1987.acc$RUNID
  <li>for all Januaries:  pdE $RUNID JAN*.acc$RUNID
  <li>for a whole year:   pdE $RUNID *1987.acc$RUNID
       </ul>
       <p>
       For pdE to work properly, the directory /u/cmrun/$RUNID has to exist
       and contain at least ${RUNID}ln  ${RUNID}uln  ${RUNID}.exe .
       The output files will end up in the PRESENT WORKING DIRECTORY which
       may be /u/cmrun/$RUNID or any other directory;
       names and order of the inputfiles are irrelevant (as long as the
       format of the files is compatible with the model ${RUNID}).
       </p>

       <p>It is possible to use pdE to average acc-files from several runs,
       e.g. average over an ensemble of runs. Although the numbers that
       are produced are fine, subroutine aPERIOD will not
       be able to create the proper labels: the runID will be taken from
       the last file that was read in and the number of runs averaged will
       be interpreted as successive years, so averaging years 1951-1955
       of runs runA runB runC runD will produce the label ANN1951-1970.runD
       rather than  ANN1951-1955.runA-D. Some titles will also suffer from
       that 'bug', but it should be easy to fix it manually afterwards,
       if anybody cares.</p>
</ol>
<p>Note that the output can be controlled (a little) by the settings in
'Ipd' (which is created if it does not yet exist in the present working
directory). A number of files will be created whose names contain the
accumulated time period.  (monyear[-year] where mon is a 3-letter acronym
for a period of 1-12 consecutive months).</p>
<pre>
        monyear.PRT      the printout
        monyear.j$RUNID  zonal budget pages (ASCII Aplot format)
        monyear.jk$RUNID latitude-height binary file
        monyear.il$RUNID longitude-height binary file
        monyear.ij$RUNID lat-lon binary file
        monyear.wp$RUNID Wave power binary file
        monyear.oij$RUNID lat-lon binary file for ocean diagnostics
        monyear.ojl$RUNID lat-depth binary file for ocean diagnostics
        monyear.oht$RUNID lat ASCII file for ocean heat transports
</pre>
<p>which can be read using the appropriate graphical software. </p>

<p><A name="part2_2"><b>2) HOW-TO change what is included in the printout</b></a></p>

<p>The switches KDIAG which are set in the NAMELIST control which
subgroups of diagnostics are calculated and output. At present, there
is no simple way to pick and choose exactly which diagnostics appear,
although we are working on a scheme to do just that. Some of the
following options are rarely used, and may soon be made obsolete.
These switches can also be used in 'Ipd' input for pdE to control
which output to produce. If QDIAG=.true. some binary files
are created accompanying the printed output. If QDIAG_ratios=.true.
fields which are the products of q1 and q2 and whose titles are
of the form "q1 x q2" are replaced by the ratios field/q2, the
title being shortened to "q1" (default).</p>

<p>Current options are:
<pre>
KDIAG(1)  < 9 print Zonal/Regional budget pages
   = 8 only print regional diagnostics
   2-7 only print global zonal means
   = 1 print all zonal diagnostics

KDIAG(2)  = 0 print Latitude-height diagnostics
          = 1 print at most fields listed in file Ijk
              (rearranging the lines of Ijk has no effect)
          = 8 Only print spectral analysis of standing eddies
          = 9 skip all Latitude-height diagnostics
          2-7 same as 1

KDIAG(3)  = 0 standard printout, all binary files if QDIAG=.true.
          = 1 ij-fields as in list Iij, all ijk-fields
          = 2 ij and ijk fields are handled according to list Iij
          = 7 ij-fields as in list Iij, no ijk-fields are produced
          = 8 full list Iij of available fields is produced; this list may
              be edited : don't touch lines starting with 'List' or 'list'
                          you may delete any other lines
                          you may rearrange the remaining ij-fields
                          you may add blank maplets
          = 9 no ij and ijk diagnostics are produced
          3-6 same as 2

KDIAG(4)  < 9 print time history table of energies
KDIAG(5)  < 9 print spectral analysis tables

KDIAG(6)  < 9 print diurnal cycle diagnostics at selected points (up to 4)
          1-4 print out for first 4-KDIAG(6) points (will soon be obsolete)
        -1 - -4 print out for -KDIAG(6) point only.

KDIAG(7)  < 9 print wave power tables

KDIAG(8)  < 9 print tracer diagnostics
          = 0 print all tracer diagnostics
          = 1 skip lat/lon tracer diagnostics
          = 2 skip tracer conservation diagnostics and lat/lon diagnostics

KDIAG(9)  < 9 print out conservation diagnostics
KDIAG(10) < 9 print out Longitude-height diagnostics
KDIAG(11) < 9 print out river runoff diagnostics
KDIAG(12) < 9 print out ocean diagnostics (if there is an ocean)
</pre>

<p>There is also one section of special lat-lon diagnostics which can
be optionally accumulated and output. These are the <i>isccp_diags</i>
which calculate some cloud properties as if they were being observed
by satellite. This is set as an option in the rundeck
(<tt>isccp_diags=1</tt>) to calculate them. By default these diags are
not calculated.</p>

<p><A name="part2_3"><b>3) HOW-TO produce daily/monthly or seasonal
diagnostics</b></a></p>

<p>Controlling the frequency of output of the ACC files is done using the
NAMELIST parameter NMONAV. This sets the number of months over which
the diagnostics is accumulated. If it is set to 3, seasonal acc files
are produced. If set to 12, you will get annual means. Higher numbers
could be chosen, but are probably not very useful.</p>

<p>Producing more frequent diagnostics is controlled by the SUBDAILY
module. The frequency of saving is controlled by the variable
<tt>Nsubdd</tt> which is the number of internal timesteps between each
snapshot (i.e. <tt>Nsubdd=1</tt> implies diags every timestep, =24
daily (if dtsrc=3600), =48 is daily for dtsrc=1800).  The variables
saved are controlled by the strings <tt>SUBDD, SUBDD1</tt>, which are
space seperated lists of names for the required diagnostics.  These
are currently limited to instantaneous values (with some exceptions as
noted below) of some standard fields (SLP, PS, SAT, PREC, QS, LCLD,
MCLD, HCLD, PTRO QLAT, QSEN, SWD, SWU, LWD, LWU, LWT, STX, STY, ICEF,
SNOWD, TCLD, SST, SIT, US, VS, TMIN, TMAX), the geopotential height,
relative and specific humidity and temperature on any (or all) of the
following fixed pressure levels (if available): 1000, 850, 700, 500,
300, 100, 30 , 10, 3.4, 0.7, .16, .07, .03, and velocities on any
model level. The fixed pressure level diags are set using Z850, R700
and T100, for instance, to request the 850 mb geopotential height, 700
mb relative humidity and 100 mb temperatures, respectively. Requests
for ZALL or TALL, will produce individual files of all available
levels. The velocities are set using U1, U5, U12, for instance, to get
the 1st, 5th and 12th layer U velocities, respectively. If "ALL"
levels are requested for a velocity, only one file per variable will
be output, containing all requested levels.  To limit the number of
output levels, set the <tt>LmaxSUBDD</tt> parameter in the rundeck,
and only levels L=1,LmaxSUBDD will be output. <p>More options can be
added as cases in subroutine get_subdd in DIAG.f if required. For
example, including the following string in the rundeck
(i.e. <tt>SUBDD="SLP SAT Z500 R850 U5 V5"</tt> will produce diags of
the sea level pressure, surface air temperature, 500mb geopotential
heights, 850 mb level relative humidity and the 5th layer U, and V
fields. Each timeseries will be output one month at a time in files
named SLPmmmyyyy and SATmmmyyyy (for example) for each month and
year. Restarts will find the appropriate file and continue to append
records as would be expected.</p>

<p> There are three minor special cases to the procedure outlined
above. i) PREC will give the accumulated precipitation over the Nsubdd
period. ii) TMIN and TMAX are the minimum and maximum daily composite
surface air temperatures at each grid point, and therefore can only be
output once a day. Note that Nsubdd must divide into the daily number
of internal timesteps for this to work properly. i.e. if dtsrc=1800s,
there are 48 internal time steps per day. If Nsubdd=6 (denoting 3
hourly output), TMIN and TMAX will be output correctly at midnight UTC once a
day. However, if Nsubdd=5 (2.5 hourly output), TMIN and TMAX will only
be output every five days as the output hour coincides with midnight UTC.</p>

<p>You can easily keep track of the running average of all the
printout diagnostics using the NIPRNT switch in the parameter
database. By setting this to a positive number, the diagnostics will
be printed out that number of hours. (i.e. setting NIPRNT=10, will
print out the running average of the accumulated diagnostics at the
end of each of the next ten hours).</p>

<p><A name="part2_4"><b>4) HOW-TO control the format of the binary output
(i.e. GISS/netcdf/hdf etc.)</b></a></p>

<p>The binary output created from 'pdE' can be in a number of
formats. Currently there are two options, the traditional GISS
formats, and netcdf output. This is set by choosing to compile the
model with POUT (for GISS-style output) or POUT_netcdf (for netcdf
output). This is set in the rundeck. Note that the choice is made AT
THE TIME OF COMPILATION OF THE MODEL EXECTUABLE. If you subsequently
change your mind, you must edit the rundeck and recreate the
executable (using 'gmake exe RUN=E001xyz'). </p>

<p>Other formats (HDF?) could be defined as you like with a suitable
POUT_xyz.f file.</p>

<p><A name="part2_5"><b>5) HOW-TO calculate a model score</b></a></p>

<p>There is an RMS.f program in the aux/ directory which calculates a
'score' for a model run based on the RMS difference with some selected
observations. Additionally, it calculates the Arcsin Mielke score (AMS),
which is a non-dimensional statistic (between -1,1 (1 being perfect))
which also includes effects of mean bias and variance. It is compiled
whenever the 'gmake aux RUN=....'  command is run. Like CMPE001 or qc,
it is technically model dependent (since it uses im,jm etc.), but in
practice you will not need to recompile it for every version. The
executable will be put into the RUNNAME_bin directory (i.e. for gmake
aux RUN=E001xyz, the executable will be E001xyz_bin/RMS). Running RMS
on its own gives its usage.</p>

<p>You should produce diagnostic files over at least a five year mean. So
for a particular run, use pdE to create the JAN and JUL averages</p>

<pre>
      cd E001xyz
      pdE E001xyz JAN195[1-5].accE001xyz    # => JAN1951-1955.ijE001xyz
      pdE E001xyz JAN195[1-5].accE001xyz    # => JUL1951-1955.ijE001xyz
</pre>

<p>Make sure that the TOPO file is linked:</p>

<pre>
      E001xyzln</pre>

<p>and then run RMS</P>

<pre>
      ~/modelE/decks/E001xyz_bin/RMS E001xyz JAN1951-1955.ijE001xyz JUL1951-1955.ijE001xyz</pre>

<p>This will create files 'E001xyz' in the directories
/u/cmrun/modelE/RMS and /u/cmrun/modelE/AMS, which contain the RMS
statistics and the Arcsin Mielke score for each selected
field,respectively. You can then compare these scores with other
existing versions.
