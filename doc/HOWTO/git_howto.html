    <h3><A name="part1_1a"><b> Git </b></A></h3>

<p>
Git is a revision control system as CVS is. The main difference
between these two systems is that Git is a &quot;distributed&quot; revision
control system. This means that each checked out copy of the code
(&quot;cloned&quot; in git terms) contains the entire history of the project and 
in theory can serve as a new repository. This allows to perform a lot
of operations locally, without accessing the central repository. 
These operations include looking into the history, switching between
the branches, comparing modified code in the local directory to the
original code etc. Local operations are much faster and one doesn't
need network access when performing them. Particularly useful are
local commits. &quot;git commit -a&quot; will commit changes to local
repository, nobody will see them until they are sent to central
repository (with &quot;git push&quot;). So while working on ones own code the
developer can do a lot of commits to memorize the various stages 
of the local code. These commits will not interfere with other peoples
work and will not be visible to others until the developer sends them 
to the central repository with &quot;git push&quot;. One should remember though
that until the code is pushed to the central repository it is
developers responsibility to back it up. Since by its nature Git
doesn't force the developer to send changes to the central repository
as often as CVS does, it is advisable that one keeps the local copy of
the code on a filesystem which is regularly backed up.

      <h3><A name="part1_1a"><b> Setting Up </b></A></h3>
<p>
To work with Git you need to have it installed on your computer. 
We are planning to use some functionality which was added in 1.7.0
version of git. So preferably you should install version no older than
1.7.0 . Older version will work for most operations but you may see
some problems in the future. On Discover the latest version of Git 
is available as a module. You can load it with:
<pre>
  module load other/git-1.7.3.4
</pre>
If you want to install it on your own workstation or laptop, 
git is available through Mac ports on Mac and as a rpm package on
Linux (use EPEL repository on Red Hat 5).
 Of course, you can always compile it from
the source (real easy) which you can get from
<pre>
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">http://git-scm.com/download</a>
</pre>
You also have to set the following environment variables:
<pre>
  export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&quot;<tt>your_name</tt>&quot;
  export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=<tt>your_email</tt>
  export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=&quot;<tt>your_name</tt>&quot;
  export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=<tt>your_email</tt>
</pre>
where <tt>your_name</tt> is the name Git will be using to identify you 
(in commit info etc.), so preferably use your full name like 
&quot;John Smith&quot; to avoid confusion. <tt>your_email</tt> is the email which will
be stored together with your name and which people can use to contact
you. If you are going to use Git on more than one computer make sure
that these variable are set to identical values on all computers.

      <h3><A name="part1_1a"><b>Useful Git commands</b></A></h3>
<ol>
<p>
(apart from the initial &quot;git clone ...&quot; all commands are executed
from inside of modelE directory tree)
</p>

<LI> <A name="part1_1a"><b>  to check out the main branch of modelE
</b></A>
<p>
  (equivalent of &quot;cvs checkout modelE&quot;)
<pre>
    git clone <tt>username</tt>@simplex.giss.nasa.gov:/giss/gitrepo/modelE.git
</pre>
where <tt>username</tt> is your username on simplex. This will create a
directory modelE with all model code in it. It will also create a
hidden directory modelE/.git with Git version control information
in it (this among other things will include entire history of the
code so that a lot of Git operations can be performed without
access to the main server).
</p>

<LI> <A name="part1_1a"><b>   to switch to a branch </b></A>
<p>
(after you downloaded the code with &quot;git clone...&quot;) 
<pre>
    git checkout <tt>branch_name</tt>
</pre>
this will switch the entire directory tree to the branch
<tt>branch_name</tt>. To see the list of available branches type 
<pre>
    git branch -a
</pre>
If you want to switch to a remote branch (prefixed with &quot;remotes&quot;)
use a &quot;short&quot; <tt>branch_name</tt> for this branch (omitting
&quot;<tt>remotes/origin</tt>&quot;). I.e. if you want to work with the branch 
<tt>remotes/origin/AR5_branch</tt> just do
<pre>
    git checkout AR5_branch
</pre>
The first time you execute this command Git will say that it has 
created a local branch <tt>AR5_branch</tt> which is &quot;tracking&quot; a remote 
branch. Next time it will just switch the branch. 
</p>

<LI> <A name="part1_1a"><b> to update the code in your working directory to the latest code
in the repository on simplex</b></A>
<p>
 (equivalent of &quot;cvs update&quot;):
<pre>
    git pull
</pre>
This will &quot;pull&quot; the latest changes from the repository you 
cloned from (<tt>simplex.giss.nasagov:/giss/gitrepo/modelE.git</tt> in
our case). Typically one should always use this simple command, unless 
one needs to do something fancy, like pulling from a private
repository of other user. In that case one can use more explicit command
<pre>
    git pull <it>username</it>@host_name:/path_to_modelE_dir branch_name
</pre>
But be carefull when using this explicit command, for example, if you 
omit branch_name you will be pulling from the master branch, even if 
locally you are on a different branch.
</p>

<LI> <A name="part1_1a"><b> to commit your code to the central
repository on  simplex </b></A>
<p>you have to execute two commands:
<pre>
    git commit -a
    git push
</pre>
The first one commits the code &quot;locally&quot;, i.e. it stores this
information in .git subdirectory. The second command &quot;pushes&quot; this
information to the central repository on simplex. Once the
information is successfully pushed to simplex Git will send a
message to the list with the commit info (similar to commit
messages we are getting now from CVS). So if you don't receive
such message you may want to check if your &quot;commit&quot; and &quot;push&quot;
went through correctly.
</p>
<p>
If you are working on more than one branch, then instead of 
&quot;git push&quot; it is more safe to execute 
<pre>
    git push origin HEAD
</pre>
This will push only your current local branch to the remote branch
with the same name, while &quot;git push&quot; will push changes on
all your branches which were committed but not pushed yet (and that 
may be not what you want).
</p>
<p>
It is possible that when you try to &quot;push&quot; Git will complain
about possible conflicts and refuse to push. This situation is
similar to trying to do &quot;cvs commit&quot; when your code in not
up-to-date. In this case you have to do &quot;git pull&quot;, resolve
conflicts in your local directory and then repeat &quot;git commit&quot;,
&quot;git push&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes &quot;git pull&quot; will request that you do local &quot;git commit&quot;
first. This is to prevent your local code from being corrupted
by conflicts with imported code. In this case do &quot;git commit -a&quot;
as advised by Git and repeat &quot;pull&quot;. Typically Git produces
useful messages when executing the commands. If something
doesn't work as expected read them and most likely you will know
what to do.
</p>
</OL>

<p>
This small set of commands should get you started. Eventually
we will post a more complete list here. You can also read
comprehensive Git manuals and tutorials at
<pre>
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">http://git-scm.com/documentation</a>
</pre>
Also, typing
<pre>
    git <tt>command</tt> --help
</pre>
will produce manual pages for the particular Git <tt>command</tt>.
If you have questions related to Git send me an email, or,
better, post them to Modeling Guru forum:
<pre>
  <a href="https://modelingguru.nasa.gov/thread/4743?tstart=0">https://modelingguru.nasa.gov/thread/4743?tstart=0</a>
</pre>
so that others could profit from the answers. You also may
get your answers quicker since other people familiar with
Git may read it.
 
As with CVS we will have a Git repository viewer installed at

    <h3><A name="part1_1a"><b> Working with branches </b></A></h3>
<p>
Git treats branches as local objects, which means that by default 
information about a new branch is not pushed to parent repository. 
Also, <tt>git clone ...</tt> doesn't add the branches from the 
remote repository to the local repository. To see all local branches
one can execute
<pre>
    git branch
</pre>
Typically for a fresh clone this will show just a <tt>master</tt>
branch. One can though see the branches in a remote repository with
<pre>
    git branch -r
</pre>
But if one wants to work with a remote branch one has to set up a
local branch which is &quot;tracking&quot; a remote branch. For
example, to work with <tt>origin/AR5_branch</tt> branch one can create
a local branch with 
<pre>
    git checkout --track -b AR5_branch origin/AR5_branch
</pre>
Starting with the Git version 1.7 this command can be shortened to
<pre>
    git checkout AR5_branch
</pre>
Once a local branch has been created one can always switch to it with 
<pre>
    git checkout branch_name
</pre>
The fact that <tt>AR5_branch</tt> we have just created is tracking a
remote branch means that <tt>git pull</tt> will update your local
branch from a remote repository and <tt>git push</tt> will send your
local changes to a remote branch. One should mention that if for a
local branch we have chosen a name which is different from the name of
a remote branch then <tt>git pull</tt> will still update the local
branch from the remote one, but <tt>git push</tt> will have no
effect. One can use this functionality to create ones own branch which
one wants to periodically update from a public remote branch.
</p>
<p>
To create a simple local branch (which will start from the current
checked out state) typically one does
<pre>
    git checkout -b branch_name
</pre>
If one wants then to commit it to central repository (to make it
available to other users) one can do it with 
<pre>
    git push origin branch_name
</pre>
</p>
<p>


</p>


    <h3><A name="part1_1a"><b> Using Git as a CVS server </b></A></h3>
<p>
Git is capable of simulating the behavior of CVS server, which 
means that one can access central Git repository using &quot;cvs&quot; 
(instead of &quot;git&quot;) on local machine. The use of such method 
is not encouraged and should be avoided if at all possible, 
but there may be circumstances when one can't use &quot;git&quot; 
(you have no control over local machine and can't install Git, 
connection is too slow to download the entire repository, 
you use a regression script which was written for CVS and 
was not yet converted to Git etc.). 
</p>
<p>
If you decide to use this method keep in mind that only limited
set of CVS operation is supported (pretty much just simple 
&quot;checkout&quot;, &quot;update&quot; and &quot;commit&quot;). 
The execution may be very 
slow (may have to wait for several minutes) since Git has to 
build a special database for it. Set the following environment 
variable:
<pre>
  export CVS_SERVER=&quot;git cvsserver&quot;
</pre>
then you can check out the main branch of the model with:
<pre>
  cvs -d username@simplex.giss.nasa.gov:/giss/gitrepo/modelE.git \
      checkout -d modelE master
</pre>
To check out a particular branch &quot;branch_name&quot; do:
<pre>
  cvs -d username@simplex.giss.nasa.gov:/giss/gitrepo/modelE.git \
      checkout -d branch_name branch_name
</pre>
Keep in mind that &quot;cvs status&quot; will always show that you are on the 
main trunk even if you have checked out a branch. It is up to you 
to remember this info. Also, this &quot;simulated&quot; CVS repository has 
nothing to do with the original CVS repository we were using before
the switch to Git. Don't try to use these commands on the modelE 
directory checked out from the old CVS repository - it will destroy
your code. This method should be treated just as a temporary hack.
